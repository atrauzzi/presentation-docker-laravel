# Laravel Docker Presentation

This repository offers a basic step-by-step example of Docker basics using Laravel PHP.  Commits are done in order to show how you evolve your containers' configuration to add functionality.

*Be sure to check this file if you are following through the commit history to see if commands need to be run.*


## Requirements

Docker is a linux-based technology and as such you'll need to be running Linux as your main OS, [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io) or a virtual machine running Linux to go through this repository.

On top of having access to Docker, you will also need a git client to check out this repository and - if needed - move through the steps.  No local install of PHP will be required.


## Commands 

In an effort to keep things simple, this demo will not create any shell scripts or use a container management tool.  Some command line is required however.

When commits require new commands, those commands will be added to this section.

** Please check out a phase to see commands. **
